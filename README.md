Team Project

Walk Through a Procedurally Modelled World
The goal of this project is to create a program using OpenGl for walking through a procedurally created virtual
world, say a forest of trees, plants, bushes etc., or an urban city with roads, buildings, etc. All repeating items,
like the trees in the virtual forest or the buildings in the virtual city, should be procedurally created, using a few
user specified parameters, if necessary. The terrain must be procedurally created. Please look up the web to
get a clear idea of what is procedural modeling. If our project does not clearly demonstrate procedural
modeling, your project will get a reduced score. You are allowed to borrow digital assets for non-repeating
items, like a bridge, for textures, and so on, as needed in order to create the virtual world. However ensure
that you credit the source properly. You should have simple interaction mechanisms to navigate through the
virtual world and view it from different angles. During navigation, the user must not be allowed to pass through
objects.
