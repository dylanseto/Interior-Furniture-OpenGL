Team Project

Interior Furniture Layout Design in 3D
The goal of this project is to create an interactive tool using OpenGl for layout of furniture in a room, say living
room, dining room, bedroom, or an outdoor landscape, sports field with players, etc. The tool will allow a user
(designer) to pick objects from a small repository, and then orient and position them on the floor/terrain or the
wall depending on the object type. The designer should also be able to choose colours/textures to the walls,
ceiling and floor/terrain. The room can be viewed from any angle. You are allowed to borrow digital assets
(like the furniture and decorative items, textures, and so on) as needed in order to create the repository. 3D
Warehouse from google is one such source for such 3D models. However ensure that you credit the source
properly. Items when being moved within the room for repositioning should not be allowed to pass through
other items or through walls, floors, ceiling etc. The functionality to interactively select an object from a
repository and to position/orient it at a desired location is mandatory. Absence of this functionality will result in
a reduced score for the project
